# Reports Job

This Foundation-internal repository contains the necessary instructions for Travis CI to be able to send the periodic reports (which are implemented in the [metadata-tool](https://github.com/finos/metadata-tool)).  It is not intended for use outside of the Foundation, and is unlikely to be interesting, except as an example of how to use Travis as a general purpose scheduled task engine.
