# SSF ESCo Reports

This Foundation-internal repository contains the necessary instructions for Travis CI to be able to send the ESCo monthly reports (which are implemented elsewhere).  It is not intended for use outside of the Foundation, and is unlikely to be interesting, except as an example of how to "trick" Travis into being a more general scheduled task engine beyond builds.
